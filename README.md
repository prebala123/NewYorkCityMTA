# New York City MTA Analysis

This project analyzes the average ridership between different subway stations in the New York City MTA to understand where the highest levels of congestion are. We use a graph representation to model the subway network and use properties of graphs to summarize the congestion at and between stations

## Retrieving the Data

First download the two datasets from <br>
(1) https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Stations/39hk-dx4f/about_data <br>
(2) https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Origin-Destination-Ridership-Estimate-2/jsu2-fbtj/about_data

Make sure that the files are called <br>
(1) MTA_Subway_Stations_updated.csv <br>
(2) MTA_Subway_Origin-Destination_Ridership_Estimate__2024_20241008.csv

Then add the csv files to the `data` folder.

## Running the Project

First install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then run the Jupyter Notebook to get the results of the analysis.
